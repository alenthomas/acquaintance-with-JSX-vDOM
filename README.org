#+TITLE: Getting started with JSX
#+AUTHOR: Alen Thomas

** What is JSX
  - A good introduction to JSX can be found here [[https://jasonformat.com/wtf-is-jsx/][What is JSX]]
** What is JSX; tldr
   - JSX is just a format that is used, the real work is done by the transpiler
   - the transpiler takes this form and calls a function with the args

#+BEGIN_SRC js
/** @jsx transform
*/
let vdom = <div id='foo'>Hello !</div>

// this will be executed as
let vdom = transform(
  'div',
  { id: 'foo' },
  ' Hello !'
)
#+END_SRC
   - we can define the function and its return values
   - here [[https://babeljs.io][babel]] transpiles the JSX and returns a JSON object with a node-name, its attributes and children
#+BEGIN_SRC js
/** @jsx transform
*/
function transform(nodeName, attributes, ...args) {
  let children = args.length? [].concat(args):{}
  return {nodeName, attributes, children}
}

let vdom = <div id='foo'>Hello !</div>

JSON.stringify(vdom, null, 2)

{
  "nodeName": "div",
  "attributes": {
    "id": "foo"
  },
  "children": [
    " Hello !"
  ]
}
#+END_SRC
