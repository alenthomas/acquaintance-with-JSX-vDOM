** Declarative
** Component-Based
** A simple Component
   - React components take input data and return what to display
   - Input data passed can be accessed by =render()= via =this.props=
** A Stateful Component
   - a component can maintain /internal state data/ via =this.state=
   - when a component's /internal state data/ changes, =render()= is re-invoked automatically
